**EquaHash Core** | [VRF-PoW] [ASIC-Resistant] [Mobile-First]
A novel Proof-of-Work blockchain combining:
- 🎲 **VRF-based fair mining**: Candidate selection via `P = sqrt(hashrate)/∑sqrt(H_global)`
- ⚡ **RandomX improved version**: forced single-thread optimization, measured mobile CPU efficiency of 0.8 H/s
- ⚖️ **Three-tier reward model**: 70% block reward + 20% small miner pool + 10% community fund
- 📱 **Zero Trust Light Node**: WASM-based PoW verification, traffic <1MB/day

```bash
# Developer Quick Start
git clone https://github.com/equahash/equahash-core.git
cd equahash-core && make testnet

Core modules:

consensus/ - VRF+Slashing implementation

miner/ - Adaptive power consumption mining algorithm

specs/ - White paper and economic model formula


### **Second, community-friendly version (for ordinary users)**
```markdown
**🌍 EquaHash: A blockchain that allows mobile phones to mine fairly**

We are solving the core problems in the PoW field:
- ❌ **Hash power monopoly** → Suppress large miners through VRF randomization + hash power square root
- 📱 **High participation threshold** → Android/iOS devices can mine, daily average power consumption <5%
- 💰 **Reward centralization** → Unique small miner protection pool (20% reward allocated to ordinary users)

**Why contribute? **
- 🏆 Get EQH token rewards (Gitcoin bounty is open)
- 🛠️ Participate in projects that change the history of cryptocurrency
- 📈 Your code will be run by millions of mobile devices

```diff
! Urgent contributions are needed:
+ Rust developers (optimize VRF module)
+ Mobile engineers (power saving algorithm)
+ Multi-language document translation

### **Three, key elements disassembly**

1. **Technical keywords front **

- Use tags such as `[VRF-PoW]`, `[ASIC-Resistant]` to facilitate SEO search

- Direct display of core algorithm formulas (reflecting mathematical rigor)

2. **Pain point solutions**

- Comparison of traditional PoW problems → EQH's innovative solutions

- Example:

```markdown

## 🔧 Traditional problems vs EQH solutions

| Problems | Our solutions |

|---------------------|-------------------------------|

| ASIC monopoly computing power | Single-threaded optimized RandomX improved version |

| Mobile phones cannot participate | WASM light node + dynamic power consumption control |
```

3. **Call to action (CTA)**

- Clearly guide users on how to participate:

4. **Data visualization** (optional)
Use ASCII charts to show technical advantages:
```markdown
## 📊 Comparison of computing power distribution (simulated data)
Bitcoin |██████████░░░░| 65% top10% miners
EQH |██████░░░░░░░░| 41% top10% miners

--------------------------------------------------------------
### Technological breakthroughs
- 🧩 **Molecular proof mechanism**: PoW + VRF + Slashing trinity
- 📉 **ASIC invalidation**: GPU efficiency is 30% lower than mobile phone CPU ([test report](benchmarks/2023-09.md))
- ⏳ **Delayed fairness**: Small miners' block delay compensation algorithm
